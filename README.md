ðŸ§  rag-doc-assist: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Knowledge Assistant

Overview

rag-doc-assist is an AI-powered knowledge assistant that allows you to query your own documents using the power of large language models. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide concise, context-aware answers from documents stored in a local folder.

This project uses LangChain, OpenAI, and Chroma for vector storage, along with an intelligent AI agent that automatically selects the appropriate loader for each document based on its content.
